Sinatra App
Introduction

To practice everything we've learned over the last couple days, your task is to build a full blown Sinatra app from scratch. It should have full CRUD for a single model with a RESTful controller and corresponding views.

What can you make? You're welcome to be creative, but if you need some ideas:

An app to help organize your fancy scotch collection
An app for a library to know which books are currently lent out
An app for a restaurant kitchen to know what orders have come in
As long as you're practicing the skills we've learned this week and making an awesome app, you'll win.

Exercise

Requirements

Use ActiveRecord to make a SQL-backed model
Make a RESTful controller that renders views (don't forget new, show, edit, too!)
Make templates with ERB
Use them CSS skills - make it look great!
